            <div class="resText">I am a programmer that has worked on all aspects of web development as well as embeded systems.  
                Basically, I can do it all.  My favorite types of projects involve my love of mathematics combined with the problem solving of writing code.  
                In this line of work, I get to do puzzles all day long and get paid for it.
